                    The Tetris Effect is the idea that you tend to miss what you are not looking for and therefore must
                    try to focus on the positive aspects of your life so that you can reap the benefits of happiness

                    list of three things that you are grateful for, which is why I have created{' '}
                    <a href="https://gratitude-li.netlify.app/">this</a> tool to help with that.
